                    I forgot where I was born so I'll just say London, since London is cool and has 
                    a giant ferris wheel. That's cool. Speaking of cool, I remember my initial surroundings to be miserably cold,
                    similarly inside of a fridge at 4 degrees Celcius. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for when I was born, it was on the
                    1st of July, 1984. It never felt like any time passed since the day of my birth. Perhaps it's my own personal conception of
                    time that makes me feel as if that time barely passes, or perhaps it's because I constantly live in 
                    the present, which forces me to perceive most of my time spend now. I often forget about 
                    my birthdays since they keep happening once a year.

                        My body according to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body'>Wikipedia</a>, is comprised of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. 
                        Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. As 100 grams of bananas
                        have the equivalent of 358 milligrams of potassium on average and I weigh approximately 60 kilograms at the time of writing this information.

         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my speculative theory, that means I am worth about 0.00358% in bananas. Ignoring all the other elemental compositions, It is entirely plausible to transmute myself 
                        into purely bananas with that percentage. This also factors in the definite fact that bananas are mostly made of potassium and the rest of the banana is empty space, 
                        similar to my skull. I recently discovered this when I performed an x-ray using a poorly modified microwave, my smartphone and a poorly modified printer. The phone and printer
                        were relatively intact after my initial usage of the contraption, but the microwave was set on fire. This is why I would recommend everyone to have a portable fire extinguisher in every 
                        room of one's personal household.

                <p>
                    Personally, I believe Pizza to be the <em>best</em> food in existence. The most simple constituents being a wheat (<i lang='la'>triticum</i>) based circular food,
                    layered with tomato (<i lang='la'>solanum lycopersicum</i>) and cheese (<i lang='la'>caseus</i>). Anything else is unacceptable in my eyes for the bare minimum of what is 
                    recognisable to be defined as a 'pizza'. In my unswayed opinion, pizza is humanity's most prized food. It is in my top ten list of events that have occurred,
                    surpassing the invention of sliced bread. The versatility of it rivals that of cereal for it's ability to fulfill the role of a model
                    breakfast, appeasing the sensation known as 'hunger'. I find myself most irritable when this occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                   I've also dedicated 2 weeks of my life to researching if it was possible to define Pizza as a category of sandwich.
                   Unfortunately, the closest definition I obtained was an 'open-faced sandwich' which isn't as purely definable as a sandwich
                   unless I stacked two pizzas on top of each other.

                    According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse'>Wikipedia</a>, "The horse (<i lang='la'>Equus ferus caballus</i>) 
                    is a domesticated one-toed hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family
                    <i lang='la'>Equidae</i> and is one of two extant subspecies of <i lang='la'>Equus ferus</i>. The horse evolved over 
                    the past 45 to 55 million years from Eohippus, a small multi-toed creature, into the 
                    large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC,
                    and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC."

                <p>
                    My favourite animal is the horse, since I was born during the year of the horse according
                    to the Chinese Calendar. To commemorate the creation of the horse, I have generated <i>The Gallery</i>. 
                    I have chosen the horse as my subject of painting with several colors and variations. To further entice
                    people, I have contained more than two paintings in my gallery, with an astonishing twelve paintings in total. The first of these have been set to transition to the second of these paintings as an alternative version of itself.

                    According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus'>Wikipedia</a>, "
                    <i lang='la'>Corvus </i> is a widely distributed genus of medium-sized to large birds in the family <i lang='la'>Corvidae</i>. 
                    The genus includes species commonly known as crows, ravens and rooks; there is no consistent 
                    distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different 
                    species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens. The genus
                    name is Latin for crow."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My second favourite animal is the crow, specifically the rook (<i lang='la'>Corvus frugilegus</i>) as it is the only animal 
                    that I can closely interact with through the use of food on a daily basis without requiring the active maintenance 
                    of the animal, such as a pet. Unfortunately, I do not have a second gallery dedicated to this animal as I ran out of 
                    creative inspiration.
